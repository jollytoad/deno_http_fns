# Examples for `@http` packages

This package contains many examples for the whole `@http` library of functions.

Take a look at individual modules for the description and how to run the
example.

Many examples can be run directly from JSR using just Deno, but some require the
repo to be checked out and run locally, usually because they require filesystem
access.

Also see the [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md) guide for a more
holistic approach to using the `@http` function library.
